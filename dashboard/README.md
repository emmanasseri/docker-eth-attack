# Blockchain Explorer for Besu, Quorum and Ethereum

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blk-io/epirus-free/master/images/Contracts.png "Epirus Free")

## Introduction

This dockerized environment is designed for viewing private 
[Quorum](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/quorum), [Pantheon](https://github.com/PegaSysEng/pantheon-quickstart/tree/master/privacy) and [Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) networks.

## Usage

Clone the repo, navigate to the cloned directory and run the instance with:

```bash
docker-compose pull
NODE_ENDPOINT=http://<node_endpoint> docker-compose up
```

Note that if setting `NODE_ENDPOINT` to a local Ethereum instance, you may need to use the IP address associated with the Docker bridged interface. 

On Linux, the bridged adapter should be 172.16.239.1, as denoted in docker-compose.yml. To connect to a local node, start with the command:

```bash
NODE_ENDPOINT=http://172.16.239.1:8545 docker-compose up
```

On MacOS and Windows, a platform sepcific command is required due to limitations around the Docker network stack on MacOS. This is as follows: 

```bash
NODE_ENDPOINT=http://host.docker.internal:8545 docker-compose up
```

Note that in both cases, your local instance of geth must be started with `--rpcaddr 0.0.0.0` and `--rpcvhosts="*"`, or Epirus will be unable to access it.

Also note that on Windows Epirus may take a long time to come up (sometimes up to 20 minutes) due to Windows filesystem performance issues with Linux VMs.

Append the `-d` argument to run the containers in the backgroud

You will be able to access the Explorer UI via:

* http://localhost/

To stop the containers use:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

To connect to new network you should remove the volumes associated with the old network

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```
